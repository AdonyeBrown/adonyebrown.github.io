## Object detection with detectron2

Object detection is a fascinating field in computer vision that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. Unlike image classification, which simply assigns a label to an image, object detection not only classifies objects but also specifies their positions by drawing bounding boxes around them.

The main goals of object detection are to:

- Classify objects present in the image.

- Locate those objects with precise coordinates.

Object detection models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN, and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) are commonly used due to their ability to perform real-time detection and maintain high accuracy.

Object detection has a wide range of applications, from autonomous vehicles to security systems and medical imaging. By enabling machines to understand and interpret visual data, it paves the way for advanced AI-driven solutions.
