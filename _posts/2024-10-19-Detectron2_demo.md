## Object detection with detectron2

## Introduction

Object detection is a fascinating field in computer vision that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. Unlike image classification, which simply assigns a label to an image, object detection not only classifies objects but also specifies their positions by drawing bounding boxes around them.

The Main Goals of Object Detection
- Classify objects present in the image.

- Locate those objects with precise coordinates.

Object detection models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN, and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) are commonly used due to their ability to perform real-time detection and maintain high accuracy. Among these, PyTorch's Detectron 2 has emerged as a powerful tool for this purpose


### Why Detectron2?

Detectron 2, developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), is an open-source library built on the PyTorch framework. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and algorithms for various computer vision tasks, making it a versatile choice for developers and researchers alike.



## Getting Started with Detectron 2
### Installation
First, you'll need to install Detectron 2 and its dependencies

```bash
pip install detectron2
