# Understanding Data Integration
# **<div align="center"> What is data integration?</div>**

Data integration is the process of combining data from various disparate sources to create a unified, consistent, and valuable view. The goal is to break down data silos and provide a single source of truth for analysis and business intelligence.

Common Challenges
🏛️ Data Silos
In this section, you'll learn how data becomes trapped in isolated systems and how centralizing it provides a complete business view. We'll visualize this transformation from a fragmented to a unified state.

Data is often stored in isolated systems that don't communicate. For example, the sales CRM, marketing platform, and finance software all hold valuable data, but separately. This fragmentation makes it impossible to get a complete view of the business, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.

Mitigation Strategy
Implement a central data repository, like a data warehouse or data lake. These systems consolidate information from all sources, providing a single, unified location for analysis and reporting. Using data integration tools with pre-built connectors automates the process of bringing this data together.
